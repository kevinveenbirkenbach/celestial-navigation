# celestial-navigation
A collection of Python scripts to assist with celestial navigation, providing tools for sight reductions, altitude corrections, and position calculations. These scripts support navigators in determining their position at sea using astronomical observations, such as sextant sights of the sun, moon, planets, and stars.
